        OUR STATEMENT OF FAITH
        <div class="hover-content">
            <strong>WHAT DOES CCF BELIEVE ABOUT THE BIBLE?</strong><br>
            We believe that the Bible, composed of 39 Old Testament books and 27 New Testament books, is the Word of God, supernaturally inspired, inerrant in its original form, infallible, so that it is our supreme authority in all matters of faith, doctrine and conduct.<br><br>

            <strong>WHAT DOES CCF BELIEVE ABOUT GOD?</strong><br>
            We believe that there is only one GOD eternally existent in three persons – Father, Son and Holy Spirit. He is the Creator of Heaven and Earth.<br><br>

            <strong>WHAT DOES CCF BELIEVE ABOUT JESUS CHRIST?</strong><br>
            We believe that Jesus Christ in the flesh is both God and Man, that He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin. He lived a sinless life. He was crucified and He died to pay the penalty of death for our sins... (full details truncated for brevity)<br><br>

            <strong>WHAT DOES CCF BELIEVE ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT?</strong><br>
            We believe that the Holy Spirit is God and possesses all the Divine attributes. He indwells all believers, baptizes and seals all believers at the moment they trust in Jesus Christ...<br><br>

            <strong>WHAT DOES CCF BELIEVE ABOUT HOW A PERSON IS SAVED?</strong><br>
            Salvation... is a free gift from God received when a person trusts in Jesus Christ to be their only Savior and Lord... (Ephesians 2: 8-9).<br><br>

            <strong>GOOD WORKS IN A CHRISTIAN’S LIFE</strong><br>
            Good works are not the means of salvation but the expected product in a true believer’s life...<br><br>

            <strong>EVERY CHRISTIAN’S MISSION</strong><br>
            Every Christian should be actively engaged in sharing the gospel and discipling others (Matthew 28:18-20).<br><br>

            <strong>BAPTISM</strong><br>
            Water baptism by immersion is an act of obedience and a public confession of faith in Jesus Christ (Matthew 28:19).<br><br>

            <strong>THE CHURCH</strong><br>
            The universal church is composed of all true believers...<br><br>

            <strong>MARRIAGE</strong><br>
            Marriage is the union of one man and one woman as biologically determined at birth...<br><br>

            <strong>GENDER</strong><br>
            God wonderfully and immutably creates each person as male or female. Rejection of one’s biological sex is a rejection of the image of God...<br><br>

            <strong>VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE</strong><br>
            All human life is sacred and created by God in His image...<br><br>

            This statement of faith does not exhaust the extent of our beliefs. Final authority rests with the CCF Board of Elders.
